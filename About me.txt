Hi, This is Inesa having several CERTIFICATIONS from some companies in Ukraine in Design, Architecture and Engineering field.

Have been involved in some big projects for several clients from USA, Germany, France, Italy and Ukraine, I could have grown my communication and technical skills. 
Now, as an independent, I've visited here to find more clients, and update them with my powerful skills and passion.

Giving perfect result to clients is my goal and would not stop working until I deliver you 100% results! Everyone has limited and constant 24 hours per day, some people are saying time flows so fast! and others are saying it flows so slowly. 
Fortunately, I am having a power to control time, so I used to pause or delay time in cases, so I could always meet the deadline and deliver perfect result!

Here goes some of my skills.
- 3D design by using Solidworks, Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360 and Creo PTC. 
- Manufacturing drawings based on 3D model/Assemblies, Architectural drawing in Autocad.
- 3D modeling & 3D rendering using 3Ds Max, V-Ray, SketchUp
- FEA, Mechanical & Structural Analysis by using Ansys and Abaqus. 

Thanks in advance.
Inesa

Best quality is my business purpose
